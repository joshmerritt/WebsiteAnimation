Description: Using an Arduino Uno and 50+ RGB LEDâ€™s, I built a two-team scoreboard wired inside an attractive, custom Walnut housing. Players can add or subtract from their displayed score using a separate button box (not pictured). Other functions include unique sounds for adding and subtracting points, game reset button, sound toggle, and ability to select between 15 and 21 point games.
